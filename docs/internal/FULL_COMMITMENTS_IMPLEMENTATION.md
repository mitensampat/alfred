## 📊 WHAT WAS BUILT

### 1. **CommitmentAnalyzer** (Full LLM Integration)
**File:** `Sources/GUI/Services/CommitmentAnalyzer.swift` (337 lines)

**Capabilities:**
- Claude API integration for intelligent commitment extraction
- Analyzes conversations to identify promises and obligations
- Distinguishes "I Owe" vs "They Owe Me" commitments
- Extracts due dates, priorities, context automatically
- Confidence scoring (only saves commitments with ≥0.6 confidence)

**Key Features:**
```swift
analyzeMessages(
    _ messages: [Message],
    platform: MessagePlatform,
    threadName: String,
    threadId: String
) async throws -> CommitmentExtraction
```

**What It Detects:**
- **I Owe patterns:** "I'll send", "I will share", "Let me get back", "I'll have it ready"
- **They Owe patterns:** "[Name] will send", "You'll share", "Please send", "Could you share by"
- **Due dates:** "today", "tomorrow", "this week", "Friday", "next week"
- **Priority:** "urgent", "ASAP", "critical" → high priority; "no rush" → low priority

---

### 2. **NotionService** (Full Commitment CRUD)
**File:** `Sources/GUI/Services/NotionService.swift` (+486 lines)

**New Methods Implemented:**

1. **`createCommitment()`** - Creates commitment in Notion with full metadata:
   - Title, Type, Status, Commitment Text
   - Committed By/To, Source Platform, Source Thread
   - Due Date, Priority, Original Context
   - Follow-up Scheduled, Unique Hash

2. **`findCommitmentByHash()`** - Checks if commitment already exists (deduplication)

3. **`updateCommitmentStatus()`** - Updates commitment status in Notion

4. **`queryActiveCommitments()`** - Fetches all open/in-progress commitments
   - Optional filtering by type (I Owe / They Owe)
   - Sorted by due date
   - Returns full Commitment objects

5. **`queryOverdueCommitments()`** - Fetches past-due commitments
   - Filters for status = open OR in-progress
   - Due date < today
   - Sorted by due date (most overdue first)

6. **`parseCommitmentFromNotionPage()`** - Converts Notion API response to Commitment model

---

### 3. **BriefingOrchestrator** (Message Fetching)
**File:** `Sources/GUI/Core/BriefingOrchestrator.swift` (+84 lines)

**New Properties:**
- `commitmentAnalyzer: CommitmentAnalyzer` - Initialized with user info & API key
- `commitmentAnalyzerPublic` - Public access for services

**New Method:**
```swift
func fetchMessagesForContact(_ contactName: String, since: Date)
    async throws -> [(message: Message, platform: MessagePlatform, threadName: String, threadId: String)]
```

**Capabilities:**
- Fetches from iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal (all enabled platforms)
- Filters by contact name (fuzzy matching)
- Date range filtering
- Returns messages with platform metadata
- Handles errors gracefully (continues if one platform fails)

---

### 4. **AlfredService** (Complete Scanning Logic)
**File:** `Sources/GUI/Services/AlfredService.swift` (scanning method fully implemented)

**What It Does:**
1. Validates configuration (commitments enabled, Notion database configured)
2. Determines contacts to scan (specific contact or all configured contacts)
3. Calculates lookback date
4. For each contact:
   - Fetches all messages since lookback date
   - Groups messages by thread
   - Analyzes each thread with CommitmentAnalyzer (LLM)
   - Checks for existing commitments (deduplication via hash)
   - Creates new commitments in Notion
5. Returns scan results (found, saved, duplicates)

---

### 5. **Commitment Model** (Full Type System)
**File:** `Sources/GUI/Models/Commitment.swift` (+60 lines)

**Added:**
- Complete initializer with all properties
- `generateHash()` static method using SHA256
- Automatic hash generation on init (for deduplication)
- CryptoKit import for secure hashing

---

## 🎯 FULLY FUNCTIONAL USER FLOWS

### Flow 1: Scan Specific Contact

```
User Opens GUI → Commitments → Scan
├─ Enters "Alex Smith"
├─ Sets lookback: 14 days
└─ Taps "Start Scan"

Background Process:
1. Fetches messages from WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal
2. Groups by conversation thread
3. Sends each thread to Claude API
4. Claude identifies: "Alex said he'll send the report by Friday"
5. Creates commitment: Type=They Owe, Due=Friday, Priority=High
6. Checks Notion - not a duplicate
7. Saves to Notion database

Result Display:
✅ 3 commitments found
✅ 2 new commitments saved
⚠️  1 duplicate skipped
```

### Flow 2: View All Commitments

```
User Opens GUI → Commitments → "All" tab
├─ Sees cards for each commitment
├─ Badges show overdue count
└─ Can switch to I Owe / They Owe / Overdue tabs

Each card shows:
- Title: "Send Q4 metrics deck"
- Type emoji: 📤 (I Owe) or 📥 (They Owe)
- From/To: "From me → Alex"
- Platform: WhatsApp
- Due date: Jan 24 (red if overdue)
- Priority: 🔴 High
```

### Flow 3: Scan All Configured Contacts

```
User Opens GUI → Commitments → Scan
├─ Leaves contact name empty
├─ Sets lookback: 7 days
└─ Taps "Start Scan"

System scans:
- All contacts in config.autoScanContacts
- E.g., ["Kunal Shah", "Akshay Aedula", "Team Members"]
- Processes hundreds of messages
- Extracts commitments across all conversations
- Saves to Notion

Result:
✅ 15 commitments found across 3 contacts
✅ 12 new commitments saved
⚠️  3 duplicates skipped
```

## ⚙️ CONFIGURATION REQUIRED

### Config.json Setup

```json
{
  "commitments": {
    "enabled": true,
    "notion_database_id": "your-notion-database-id-here",
    "auto_scan_on_briefing": false,
    "auto_scan_contacts": [
      "Kunal Shah",
      "Akshay Aedula",
      "Important Client Name"
    ],
    "default_lookback_days": 14
  }
}
```

### Notion Database Schema

Must have these properties:
- **Title** (title) - Commitment title
- **Type** (select) - "I Owe" or "They Owe Me"
- **Status** (status) - "Open", "In Progress", "Completed", "Cancelled"
- **Commitment Text** (rich_text) - Full commitment text
- **Committed By** (rich_text) - Person making commitment
- **Committed To** (rich_text) - Person receiving commitment
- **Source Platform** (select) - "imessage", "whatsapp", "signal"
- **Source Thread** (rich_text) - Contact/thread name
- **Due Date** (date) - Optional deadline
- **Priority** (select) - "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low"
- **Original Context** (rich_text) - Surrounding conversation
- **Follow-up Scheduled** (date) - Optional follow-up date
- **Unique Hash** (rich_text) - SHA256 hash for deduplication

---

## 🔬 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### LLM Prompt Engineering

The CommitmentAnalyzer uses sophisticated prompting:

```
You are analyzing a conversation to extract commitments...

Types:
1. I Owe - commitments BY the user
   - Phrases: "I'll send", "I will share", "Let me get back"

2. They Owe Me - commitments TO the user
   - Phrases: "[Name] will send", "You'll share", "Please send"

Extract:
- type: "i_owe" or "they_owe"
- title: Brief 3-8 word description
- commitmentText: Exact phrase
- committedBy/To: Names
- dueDate: ISO8601 if mentioned
- priority: Based on urgency indicators
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 score

Only extract commitments with confidence >= 0.6.
```

### Deduplication Strategy

**Hash Generation:**
```swift
SHA256(commitmentText + sourceThread + committedBy + dueDate)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Same commitment text + same conversation = same commitment
- Different due dates = different commitments (e.g., weekly promises)
- Different participants = different commitments

**Deduplication Flow:**
1. Generate hash for extracted commitment
2. Query Notion: `findCommitmentByHash(hash, databaseId)`
3. If exists → skip (increment duplicates counter)
4. If not exists → create in Notion (increment saved counter)

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation:**
- If iMessage fails → continues with WhatsApp
- If Claude API fails → throws error with message
- If Notion API fails → throws error with message
- If no messages found → returns 0 found, 0 saved

**User-Friendly Errors:**
```swift
enum ServiceError {
    case notInitialized
    case commitmentsNotEnabled
    case notionDatabaseNotConfigured
    case notImplemented(String)
}
```

## 📈 PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### API Calls Per Scan

For 1 contact, 14 days, ~50 messages across 3 threads:

1. **Message Fetching:** 3 database queries (iMessage, WhatsApp, Signal)
2. **LLM Analysis:** 3 Claude API calls (1 per thread)
3. **Notion Queries:** 1-5 queries (1 per commitment found, check for duplicates)
4. **Notion Creates:** 1-5 creates (1 per new commitment)

**Total:** ~12-16 API calls

**Time Estimate:** 5-10 seconds

### Rate Limiting

**Claude API:**
- Default: 50 requests/min
- Scanning 10 contacts = ~30 threads = ~30 API calls
- Well within limits

**Notion API:**
- Default: 3 requests/second
- Scanning creates ~10-20 requests
- Well within limits

### Optimization Opportunities (Future)

1. **Batch Notion queries** - Query multiple hashes at once
2. **Cache results** - Store commitment hashes locally
3. **Background scanning** - Scan during idle time
4. **Incremental scanning** - Only scan new messages since last scan

---

## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### 1. LLM Accuracy
- **Issue:** Claude may miss subtle commitments or misinterpret intent
- **Mitigation:** Confidence threshold (0.6) filters low-confidence extractions
- **Workaround:** Users can manually add commitments in Notion

### 2. Date Parsing
- **Issue:** Ambiguous dates like "next Friday" depend on current date
- **Mitigation:** LLM converts to ISO8601 timestamps
- **Limitation:** May misinterpret cross-month references

### 3. Multi-Language Support
- **Issue:** Prompt is English-only
- **Mitigation:** Claude handles many languages naturally
- **Limitation:** May be less accurate for non-English conversations

### 4. No Real-Time Updates
- **Issue:** Commitments only update on manual scan or refresh
- **Future:** Could add background polling or Notion webhooks
